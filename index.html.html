In the second World War the Germans extensively used the word <i>'Blitzkrieg'</i> which meant lightening war. Blitzkrieg is a word used to describe a combined arms surprise attack using a rapid, overwhelming force concentration that may consist of armored and motorized or mechanized infantry formations, together with artillery, air assault and close air support, that has the intent to break through the opponent's lines of defense, then dislocate the defenders, unbalance the enemy by making it difficult to respond to the continuously changing front, and defeat them in a decisive <i>Vernichtungsschlacht</i>: a battle of annihilation.
